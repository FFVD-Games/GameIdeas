# GameIdeas
A place where you can put your ideas for games

---Flippin' Fun Video Games---

Welcome to this repository! Feel free to put any and 
all of your gaming ideas here (with a few ground
rules)

     1. Don't put anything in here that qualifies as
        NSFW (Not Safe For Work) or 18+

     2. Don't put anything in here that you are
        planning to use for one of your projects

     3. Please please PLEASE don't put anything in
        here that is already in use by another dev/
        company. It looks rather unprofessional

Most of all, be nice to each other and have fun!
